- 👋 Hi, I’m @apuglia1, and I really like the fact you can create lots of interesting stuff by coding. And also I love technology.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a good programmer. I have almost zero knowledge, but I'm very keen and interested to improve each time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Phyton and I pretend maybe, in a few years, try changing my work area (currently at law in my country)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that a total begginer can help.
